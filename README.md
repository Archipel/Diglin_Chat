# Diglin_Chat #

This is a Magento module to display the Zopim Chat Widget into the shop. Advantage of this module is to configure the chat window per each store and store view. Please visit [Zopim](http://bit.ly/Z84KEE) to create an account and get a key.

## Features

This module allows you to integrate the Zopim chat service into your Magento installation. You can get access to the Zopim Dashboard directly from the Magento backend. This module allows you to configure for each store view:

- Text for the bubble and the chat bar/panel
- Display or not by default some chat elements (bubble, window, button)
- Define and color (depending on Zopim package paid)
- Show unread flag icon if enabled
- Display the name and email of the logged customer
- Define where to place the button (bottom left or right) and/or set an offset
- Automatically or not, set the language of the chat (based on Magento locale or not)
- Add the new API call for faster loading page (you have to enable it in the configuration chat page into Magento backend)

The difference with the official Zopim Chat Module is that here you can define the configuration for each store. It's not possible in the official one and won't be possible unless the developer decide to refactor his code. In the meantime, it respects the Magento programming philosophy.
